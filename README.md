# RAG-PDF-parser-API
A system that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable users to query a PDF document and receive accurate, contextually relevant answers based solely on the documentâ€™s content. The system handles tables and data comparisons effectively and ensures responses are derived exclusively from the PDF to maintain data integrity and prevent prompt injection attacks.

Requirements:
- PDF Parsing and Knowledge Extraction
- RAG Integration
- Data Handling and Comparison
- Response Generation
- Security Measures

Use Cases:
- Data Extraction: Users can query specific data points or summaries from tables within the PDF.
- Data Comparison: Users can request comparisons between different data sets or tables in the PDF.
- Content Verification: Users can verify specific information or claims in the PDF document.
